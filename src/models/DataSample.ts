* A Data Sample represents a medical information, provided by a Data Owner concerning one specific [Patient], for a T moment.       Provided by a Data Owner means that the data sample may have been either provided by a [HealthcareProfessional] or a [Patient], either collected by a [MedicalDevice].         Data Samples provided by the patient include subjective information, such as complaints, reason for visit, feelings, etc. or objective information       like bio-metric measures (blood pressure, temperature, heart beat, etc.), or physical exam description, diagnosis, prescription, integration of lab reports from another [HealthcareProfessional], action plan, etc.      Any action performed by the [HealthcareProfessional] (which is relevant for a [HealthcareElement] of a [Patient]) is considered as a [DataSample].       The data samples can be linked to healthcare elements or other structuring elements of the medical record
